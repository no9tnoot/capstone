Evolutionary prototype of a program that generates English questions and accompanying
mySQL queries, and checks that user-entered queries produce the expected output for a
given query.


== Prerequisites ==

To run this prototype, the user must meet the following requirements: 

 * Have the classicmodels2022 database running on a SQL server.
 * Have installed the latest version of Python.
 * Know your mySQL password.


== Installation ==

Ensure all code files are downloaded and stored in the same folder on your machine.
The database_details.txt file can be updated to hold the relevant details for your SQL server connection in the format:
'host'
'user'
'password'
'database name'


== Running ==

The software's functionality is accessed through the UserInterface class. Simply 
run UserInterface.py in your favourite environment or shell and follow the printed 
prompts.
